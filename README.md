# eResilience
eResilience is an open science initiative delivered as part of the eLife2020 Innovation Leaders cohort to increase disaster + crisis resilience through open-roadmap initiatives. See https://elifesciences.org/labs/fdcb6588/innovation-leaders-2020-introducing-the-cohort 

This work originally started with a focus on bot-countermeasures for https://www.cleanm8.com, but has expanded to a broader pivot after supporting the creation of multiple civic digital responses to the 2019-2020 fire season, such as https://crisis.app and https://ausfirehack.info 

Lessons and patterns learnt during this exercise will continue to be applied against the original target, but by broadening our vision, we increase the collaboration surface and project impact potential.

# Vision
Leverage + unit open-science collaborations to reach + support crisis impacted individuals and communities across pre, mid and post crisis impact phases.
